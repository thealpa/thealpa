Welcome to my profile! I'm a software engineer with a passion for iOS/macOS apps, design, serverless architectures, and mechanical keyboards. I'm currently working at [LOVOO](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lovoo-dating-app-live-chat/id445338486) helping people find the opposite of loneliness. I also have a degree from the Technical University of Chemnitz in Business Informatics (Computer Science + Business Administration).
